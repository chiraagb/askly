	Plaintiff, TORO PALLETS, INC, a California Corporation,, hereby files this Complaint and alleges as follows:
I. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
PARTIES
Plaintiff
Plaintiff, TORO PALLETS, INC (hereinafter referred to as “PLAINTIFF”), is now and at all times mentioned herein was, a duly registered California Corporation in good standing and doing business in the county of Los Angeles, State of California.


B.	Named Party Defendants
Defendant, RIVIERA BEVERAGES, LLC, is now and at all times  mentioned herein was, a duly registered California Corporation in good standing and doing business in the County of Los Angeles,  State of California.


DOE Defendant(s)
PLAINTIFF is unaware of the true names or capacities, whether they are individuals or business entities, of Defendant DOES 1 through 10, and therefore sues them by such fictitious names and will seek leave of this Court to insert true names and capacities once they have been ascertained.
The full extent of the facts linking the fictitiously designated Defendants with the causes
of action alleged herein is unknown to Plaintiffs at this time. Further, the true names and capacities of Defendants DOES 1 through 10, whether individual, plural, corporate, partnership, associate or otherwise are also unknown to Plaintiffs at this time. Therefore, Plaintiffs sue Defendants DOES 1 through 10 by such fictitious names and will ask leave of Court to amend this Complaint to show their true names and capacities when the same are ascertained. Said Defendants are sued as principals and/or agents, servants and employees of said principals, and all of the acts performed by them as alleged herein were performed within the course and scope of their authority and employment. Each Defendant designated herein as a "DOE" was negligently responsible, or in some other actionable manner was responsible, for the events and resultant damages incurred by the Plaintiffs as hereinafter alleged. Plaintiffs will amend this Complaint to state the manner in which each fictitious Defendant is so responsible.
Defendants, and each of them, are, and at all times herein mentioned were, corporations organized, existing under, doing business and/or were qualified to do business by virtue of the laws of the State of California. The corporate Defendants, and each of them, are, and at all times mentioned herein were, the alter-egos of each and every other Defendant and there exists, and at all times herein mentioned has existed, a unity of interest and ownership between the Defendants such that any separateness between them has ceased to exist in that the Defendants have completely controlled, dominated, managed, and operated the corporate Defendants and have intermingled the assets of each to suit their convenience. Further, the corporate Defendants are, and at all times mentioned herein were, mere shells, instrumentalities, and conduits through which the Defendants carried out their business in the corporate name, exercising complete control and dominance of such business to an extent that individuality or separateness did not, in fact, exist.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
Jurisdiction of this Court arises is based on a contract where performance was required within Los Angeles County. 
Defendants herein purposefully directed their activities to the State of California and consummated a transaction with a resident of the State of California, PLAINTIFF herein. 
As a result, Defendants caused an event or events to occur in California, and more particularly in the County of Los Angeles, out of which this action arises and which forms the basis of this action.
Venue is proper in this Court because Defendants' liability to Plaintiff arose within the jurisdictional region of this Court. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties.
